# 1 Introduction
- Motivation:  
In todayâ€™s digital landscape, politicians increasingly use platforms like Twitter to share their views, often without explicitly mentioning their party affiliation. This makes it difficult for researchers, journalists, and citizens to understand the political context behind individual statements. 
At the same time, the rise of disinformation and political polarization highlights the need for better tools to analyze political communication online. Our machine learning model addresses this gap by predicting party affiliation based solely on tweet content. 
This enables large-scale, automated analysis of political discourse, supports transparency, and helps detect patterns in political messaging that would otherwise remain hidden.
- Research question:  
Can a machine learning model accurately predict the political party affiliation of German Bundestag members based solely on the textual content of their tweets?
